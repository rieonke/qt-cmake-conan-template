# Minimal CMake And Conan Template for Qt 5 Projects

> Add conan support

[As I've briefly introduced](https://www.euler.kr/trl/2014/08/19/minimal-cmake-template/), this is a minimal, but complete and production-ready CMake project template for Qt 5 projects. This may be a starting point for your new application. If that is not intent to be a cross-platform project, you can clean up that stuffs from the template.

If you want to deploy your application on macOS, I would recommend you read below document.
